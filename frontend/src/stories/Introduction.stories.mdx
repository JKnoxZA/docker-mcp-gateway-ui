# MCP Docker Gateway Design System

Welcome to the MCP Docker Gateway Frontend Component Library. This design system provides a comprehensive set of reusable components, patterns, and guidelines for building consistent user interfaces.

## What's Inside

Our design system includes:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling and behavior
- **Patterns**: Common interaction patterns and layouts
- **Guidelines**: Design principles and usage recommendations
- **Examples**: Real-world usage scenarios and best practices

## Getting Started

### For Developers

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Storybook
npm run storybook

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build the application
npm run build
```

### For Designers

Browse through the components and patterns to understand the design language and available building blocks. Each component includes:

- Visual examples and variations
- Usage guidelines and best practices
- Code examples and API documentation
- Accessibility considerations

## Design Principles

### Consistency
All components follow consistent design patterns, ensuring a cohesive user experience across the application.

### Accessibility
Components are built with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.

### Performance
Components are optimized for performance with minimal bundle size and efficient rendering.

### Developer Experience
Components provide clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and helpful TypeScript types.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful and customizable icons
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation tool
